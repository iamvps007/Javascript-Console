**Code Debugging**
Programming code might contain syntax errors, or logical errors. Many of these errors are difficult to diagnose. Often, when programming code contains errors, nothing will happen. There are no error messages, and you will get no indications where to search for errors. Searching for (and fixing) errors in programming code is called code _debugging_.

**JavaScript Debuggers**
Debugging is not easy. But fortunately, all modern browsers have a built-in JavaScript debugger. Built-in debuggers can be turned on and off, forcing errors to be reported to the user. With a debugger, you can also set breakpoints (places where code execution can be stopped), and examine variables while the code is executing.

**Debugging code using this tool**
Using this tool you don't have to launch Browser developer tool.
just simply type your code in **index.js** and run **index.html** to see output
